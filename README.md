There are two parts to setting up this bot:the discord bot and the strava API.
Everything you need to run this bot is in the outun folder. Put this folder where you want to run the bot.
# Bot Setup
This is simple. All you have to do is put your bot token in the .env file were it says to inset it.

# Strava API Setup
The strava API is fairly simple. First you have to create an app with strava. This is done by going to this link and putting in the values it requires. The wbesite value is needed but won't be used. Put any website in for this, it doesnt even have to be real.

After this is done you will need to get the client ID
